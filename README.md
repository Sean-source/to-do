# to-do

This is a to do list application. Enter any new task on the first column of the screen. The middle column will show what needs to be completed and the last column are the completed tasks.

Since I am always using a to do list, I decided to make my own as they are good opportunity to take note of the specific actions needed to reach my goals on a day to day basis.  The caveat in this application is that you cannot delete a todo item until it has been completed. 

This application uses the model view controller layout. The view uses handlebars to dynamically generate the html and bootstrap. Jquery is used to send requests from the client to the server. The backend was built with express and mysql workbench. I built the ORM for this application which is mapping the database tables to objects. SQL uses scalar data types whereas in javascript everything is an object. This allows the data to be converted by the two incompatible type systems.
